#MicrobeDetectionEvaluation

Easy evaluation of three microbe detection data analysis methods.
##Desciption

MicrobeDetectionEvaluation implements two scripts to download and install three microbe detection data analysis methods, which are kraken, readscan and cs-score.<br>

Next-generation sequencing is changing researching methods of biological fields. Microbe detection technologies using next-generation sequencing has the advantages that can response rapidly to biothreat and handle unknown microbes. The large amount data of next-generation sequencing bring problems of high analysis precision and velocity need. In our work, we implemented a simple way to install and run three mainly used microbe detection data analysis methods. <br>

##Tools:
install.sh: download the related files and install them
run.sh: run three easy analysis example
